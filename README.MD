# About me
I am a Full-stack JS Developer with a decent experience in architecting and  building  web applications and finding new, more flexible, highly efficient, more synthetic as well as more performing and elegant ways to do it.

A far-sighted problem preventer. Being highly adaptable, I'm able to quickly pick up and work with any architecture or libraries required. I can estimate the time needed to complete a task (and a project), plan and lead the work of a team of 5-7 people to complete a project respecting the deadlines.

Passionate about creating a favorable work environment through effective  coordination and communication with managers, designers, developers and clients to produce stand-out work.  Good analytical thinking  with talent for identifying, scrutinizing and improving work processes
