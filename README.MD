# About me
I'm Junior++ Front End Developer with a decent experience in building sites, Single Page Applications and finding new, more flexible, highly efficient, more synthetic as well as more performing and elegant ways to build it. 

A far-sighted problem preventer. Being highly adaptable, I'm able to quickly pick up and work with any architecture or libraries required. I can estimate the time needed to complete a task (and a project), plan and lead the work of a team of 3-5 people to complete a project respecting the deadlines. 

Passionate about creating a favorable work environment through effective coordination and communication with managers, designers, developers and clients to produce stand-out work. 
Good analytical thinking with talent for identifying, scrutinizing and improving work processes.
